# MakeCode Extension for AHT20 Sensor

This extension enables the use of the AHT20 temperature and humidity sensor when programming the micro:bit using the MakeCode environment. The extension includes drivers that allow easy reading of temperature and humidity data as well as resetting the sensor.

The drivers are translated and optimized from the original MicroPython code available at https://www.fredscave.com/drivers/012-aht2x.html#introduction with the help of tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity.

With this extension, you can use blocks in your micro:bit programs to:
- Read temperature
- Read humidity
- Reset the AHT20 sensor

This extension simplifies integrating the AHT20 sensor into educational and experimental micro:bit projects.

To add this extension to MakeCode, follow the instructions for importing add-ons in the MakeCode environment.
